# RobotRace
In this project we implemented two robot controllers that compete in an obstacle course.  Each robot wants to reach the end of the track before the opponent avoiding collisions.

The first controller was designed manually using Motor Schemas; the other one was designed using a genetic algorithm applied to a neural network;
